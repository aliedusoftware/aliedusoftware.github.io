  <p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
  <p>Robotics</p>
  
  <h3>Why you should recruit me:</h3>
  <p>I invite you to consider why you <i>shouldn't</i> recruit me. What does one have to lose? </p>
  <p>You'll be missing out on an extremely eager and passionate software engineering student, always ready to take on new
    challenges.
  </p>
  <p>You'll be missing out on a team-player that is always ready to work with groups on any kind of development
    project.
  </p>
  <p>You'll be missing out on someone that has no particular demands besides working in an industry-grade
    environment, the perfect place to learn from experts in the field said person is extremely passionate about.
  </p>
  <p> <s>You'll only stall my inevitable path towards world domination via a mass-produced sentient robotic army</s></p>
  
  <p>Do take these into consideration before you close this tab and forget all about me!</p>
